# House-Price-Prediction
Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on various features such as square footage and the number of bedrooms. The dataset used for this project is "kc_house_data.csv."

Data Exploration
Overview
The dataset contains information about housing prices and features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes.

Data Exploration Steps
Loaded the dataset using the pandas library.
Explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Data Preprocessing
Feature Selection
Selected relevant features for training the model, including 'sqft_living' and 'bedrooms.'

Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

Model Development
Model Selection
Chose a linear regression model for its simplicity and interpretability.

Model Training
Trained the linear regression model on the training data using the fit method.

Model Evaluation
Prediction
Used the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.

Evaluation Metric
Evaluated the model's performance using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric.

Results
The Mean Squared Error on the test set was calculated to be [insert MSE value].

Visualization
Scatter Plot
Visualized the actual house prices and predicted prices on a scatter plot for the 'sqft_living' feature.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the developed linear regression model shows promise in predicting house prices based on the selected features. Further refinement and exploration, such as feature engineering or trying more complex models, could potentially improve the model's accuracy.

Recommendations
Consider incorporating additional features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
Explore more advanced regression models to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
Conduct further analysis on outliers and anomalies in the dataset to ensure model robustness.
Future Work
This project lays the foundation for house price prediction, and future work could involve:

Fine-tuning the model parameters for better performance.
Investigating and addressing potential issues such as multicollinearity.
Scaling the project for larger datasets or real-world deployment.
